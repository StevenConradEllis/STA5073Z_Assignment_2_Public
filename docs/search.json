    "section": "",
    "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are sophisticated artificial intelligence tools that assist with numerous tasks, such as compiling, processing, and writing reports, such as this one. ChatGPT, in particular, has shown remarkable capabilities in assisting with such tasks, and so it was used to assist with completing this task and the following is a detailed review of the experience.\n\nPrompting for Writing:\nWhen it came to the writing process, ChatGPT excelled when it was provided with detailed descriptions of what was required, often in concise bullet points. This structured approach allowed ChatGPT to address each point systematically. While it usually produced well-structured and coherent content, minor human adjustments were occasionally necessary for optimal results.\nIts performance deteriorated when clear and detailed instructions were not provided. In such cases, the results were less satisfactory, very generalized and often necessitated additional prompting or fine-tuning.\n\n\nPrompting for Coding:\nIn the realm of coding, ChatGPT proved to be a valuable resource for understanding and debugging errors. When presented with coding errors, it demonstrated an impressive accuracy rate of identifying the root cause of the issue.\nFurthermore, for simpler or common coding exercises, ChatGPT typically provided effective solutions on the first attempt. However, it’s with more complex coding problems, even when prompts were tuned, ChatGPT struggled to produce correct answers. This is perhaps indicative of the limitations of current AI models in handling intricate coding challenges.\n\n\nPrompting for Facts and Definitions:\nChatGPT delivered accurate facts and definitions when prompted. However, due diligence remained essential, as the information provided was cross-checking for precision.\nOne remarkable aspect of ChatGPT was its ability to explain topics comprehensively, providing definitions that allowed for a solid understanding of the subject matter. It excelled in generating examples and rephrasing information in simpler terms, which greatly aided in achieving a clear and thorough comprehension of the topics it addressed.\nIn summary, ChatGPT has proven to be a valuable tool for a variety of tasks, particularly in the realm of report compilation, coding assistance, and knowledge provision. While it excels with well-defined and detailed prompts, its limitations become apparent when instructions are less clear or when confronted with intricate coding challenges. Nevertheless, ChatGPT’s capabilities in simplifying complex concepts and generating good quality written content offer significant value in a variety of applications."

So, tabulating the text files needed some pre-processing where the years at which the speeches occurred were extracted by identifying the first 4 strings from the filenames and attributed them to a new column. Additionally, the names of the presidents were extracted from the filenames. Within the process of extracting the presidents’ names, string manipulation was performed to remove unnecessary regular expressions. Although, the dates were not specifically used in our analysis, they were parsed in a new column for our own perusal. All the unnecessary regular expressions like “(http.*?(...” from the speeches were also removed. All those manipulations were done using the stringr library. Now that we were only dealing with words, we had to make sure that all the speeches were converted to lower cases and lemmatised to avoid any redundancies. The function used to perform the lemmatisation task, was lemmatize_strings() from the textstem library. Finally, the data was converted into a tibble."

    "text": "2.4 Overall Analysis\nFor any upcoming analyses, the speeches had to be tokenised accordingly to fit the purpose of our analyses. Tokenisation is the split of a sequence of characters in a text by locating the word boundaries (Palmer 2000). The atomicity of the split could be in terms of per characters, per words, per n-grams, per sentences and more. So, tokenisation is always application dependent. For our purpose, tokenising per words and per n-grams were relevant. This was simply done using the unnest_tokens() function from the tidytext library. n-gram is a terminology very well known in the world of natural language processing (NLP), and it simply refers to a sequence of n words. If n=1, it is referred to as a unigram, if n=2, it is referred to as a bigram and if n=3, it is referred to as a trigram. The overall analysis sought to reveal the top 20 words, bigrams and trigrams used by all presidents. The steps to achieve these, followed the main procedures highlighted in Section 2.3. Then for each case, the words, bigrams and trigrams were counted, sorted in descending order and sliced to the first 20 elements. Furthermore, they were all plotted as barplots.\nA more in-depth overall analysis was performed by aggregating the above per president. However, only the overall trigrams used per presidents were analysed. The words and bigrams ones were omitted as the idea was, if we were to use more than a word anyways to do more in-depth analysis, we might as well use the trigrams as those would convey more meaningful information. So, the exact methods explained in the above paragraph were implemented with the exception that the presidents were first filtered in that same procedural pipeline."

    "text": "2.6 Sentiment Analysis\nAccording to Medhat, Hassan, and Korashy (2014), sentiment analysis also known as the opinion mining study people’s opinions, attitudes, and emotions towards an entity in a computational manner and can also be considered as a classification process. Our sentiment analysis took a lexicon dictionary-based approach which is considered as a very feasible approach as it does not involve any training data and advanced machine learning techniques (Wankhade, Rao, and Kulkarni 2022). For this reason, some experts like Yan-Yan, Bing, and Ting (2010) also referred to this approach as an unsupervised approach. The 2 main dictionaries used in our analyses were bing and nrc.\nThe bing dictionary was loaded from the tidytext library. Each of the 6786 words in the dictionary is assigned to a binary sentiment of either positive or negative. The main disadvantage of the lexicon approach is that it is highly domain-oriented. Indeed, during some analysis, words like “anti poverty”, “anti corruption”, and so on were classified as negative sentiment as the word “anti” did not exist in the bing dictionary. Therefore, this issue was resolved by adding the word “anti” in the bing dictionary and assigned a positive sentiment to it as this label fits the context of this analysis. This part of the sentiment analysis explored the top 20 positive and negative trigrams used by all presidents. The steps to achieve these, followed the main procedures highlighted in Section 2.5. Then for each case, the trigrams were filtered by either “positive” or “negative” sentiment, followed by a count and a sort in descending order and eventually sliced to the first 20 elements. Furthermore, they were all plotted as barplots.\nA more in-depth sentiment analysis was performed by aggregating the above per president. The exact methods explained in the above paragraph were implemented with the exception that the presidents were first filtered in that same procedural pipeline. It was also vital to investigate the variation of positive and negative sentiments over the years while excluding deKlerk and Motlanthe as they were only 1-term presidents. Those investigations were done for the trigrams by following the procedure as described in Section 2.5 and then plotted as barplots and line graphs. The only key aspect here was to group the sentiment and year before counting how many positive and negative sentiments were recorded per year.\nThis report also employed the NRC Emotion Lexicon for sentimental analysis, a resource that associates English words with eight fundamental emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust), along with two sentiments (negative and positive). This lexicon was used to analyse the emotions expressed in presidential speeches, providing insights into the emotional aspects of their leadership and communication."

    "section": "2.7 Topic Modelling",
    "text": "2.7 Topic Modelling\nTopic modelling is a machine learning technique that scans tokens (usually words) in sequences (usually documents), with the aim of detecting word and phrase patterns within the sequences. This is achieved by clustering word groups and similar expressions together into ‘topics’ that best characterize a set of documents. (Pascual 2019)\nTopic models can help offer insights into bodies of text, for better understanding of large collections of unstructured text bodies. (Blei 2012)\nIn this assignment topic modelling was performed as follows:\nA data-set of words that appeared in the corpus of presidential speeches was extracted into a document-term matrix, containing rows corresponding to the speeches and columns corresponding to the words.\nThe Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method was then used to extract topics from this sparse and wide document-term matrix. The LDA algorithm is guided by two principles:\n\nEvery document is a mixture of topics (for example 90% topic A and 10% topic B) and every topic is a mixture of words.\nEvery topic is a probability distribution over words.\n\nLDA draws topic distributions from a Dirichlet distribution and uses variational expectation maximisation algorithm, and collapsed Gibbs sampling (both beyond the scope of this assignment) to achieve topic model estimations.\nThe LDA() function from the topicmodels package was used to retrieve LDA topic models.\nLatent Dirichlet allocation Topic modelling was performed in the following way:\n\nThe top 5 topics were retrieved across all speeches (to retrieve president-specific topics).\nThe tidytext package was then used to extract per-topic-per-word probabilities (the “beta”) from the model.\nThe per-president-per-topic probabilities (the “gamma”) were then extracted using the tidytext package.\nThe log ratio of beta values of topics for different presidents were compared to reveal words with the greatest differences between the two presidents’ topics.\nFinally, the speeches of Ramaphosa were retrieved, and the same exercise was repeated for Ramaphosa-specific speeches (to gain insights into the topics that permeated his speeches over the years)."

    "text": "3.1 Overall Analysis\nAn overall analysis was executed on the speeches to extract the top 20 words, bigrams and trigrams used by all the presidents to obtain an idea about which of those conveyed meaningful information.\nFigure 1 represents the top 20 words, bigrams and trigrams used by all presidents. Plot A showcases that all presidents would obviously address the public most of the time. Moreover, the top words were linked to development and were very businessy. Plot B were way more meaningful than plot A and it seemed like majority of presidents were addressing private sectors more than public sectors in their speeches. They addressed the unity of nations, job creations, justice system and specific locations in South Africa. Mandela seemed to have been a model to the other presidents being the first anti-apartheid activist and president of the country, hence mentioned several times. The 2010 FIFA world cup that was held in South Africa brought such a positive and festive vibe in Cape Town, no wonder why it was in the top 20 bigrams. Plot C was even more meaningful and we could observe that the bigram “justice system” and “criminal justice” were the least occurred words in the top 20 bigram plot. That was because those particular bigrams were not that meaningful, as such plot C\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Top 20 words, pair of words (bigrams), and trio of words (trigrams) used by all presidents.\n\n\n\n\nrevealed the real meaning of the words being criminal justice system, hence that trigram had the highest occurrence. In addition, a lot of projects like trade union movement, public private partnership, child support grant, adult basic education, continental free trade, community of forum and more were the subject matter amid presidents. The economy of the country was also address in terms of the gross domestic product (GDP), however, problems like gender-based violence outweighed the number of occurrences for the country’s GDP, and this priority was valid here.\nFigure 2 displays the top 20 trigrams per president. Mandela’s trigrams clearly indicated the challenges and priorities, he was dealing at his time of presidency. Without re-emphasising on the trigrams, here’s a brief overiew. Mandela’s commitment to address social issues, improving public services, maintaining law and order, promoting workers’ rights, and ensuring a strong constitutional framework has not gone unnoticed. Once again, his presidency was characterized by a focus on reconciliation and inclusivity, as well as engagement with international matters. Overall, Mandela’s presidency was marked by his dedication to nation-building, social progress, and upholding democratic values. Due to the fact that deKlerk was only a 1-term president, all his top words had only a count of 1. Once again, the word constitution appeared multiple times. Indeed, he was dealing with a period of significant political transformation in South Africa. He was therefore working on constitutional negotiations, peace-building, and addressing political and social challenges. His presidency was marked by efforts to move away from apartheid policies and towards a more inclusive and democratic system. Mbeki’s top tier words looked quite diverse. He appeared to address issues related to security, governance, economic development, and education. Moreover, the focus on major sporting events like the soccer world cup suggested a commitment to the country’s international standing and promoting sports. Additionally, the reference to traditional leadership and community centres indicated engagement with South Africa’s cultural and local governance dynamics. As per the top 20 trigrams for Zuma, he seemed to have focused on economic policies, infrastructure development, and addressing corruption. Apart from the social and economic programs, he had to host the 2010 FIFA world cup during his tenure. Motlanthe’s trigrams was not that helpful as he was also only a 1-term president. His top 20 trigrams did not convey meaningful information. The only observation was that it appeared that he may have been dealing with a range of complex challenges, with a focus on social and economic development, justice and anti-corruption. Ramaphosa’s trigrams sounded very promising and he seemed to have focused on addressing a wide range of issues, including social challenges like gender-based violence, economic development through trade and job creation, legal and constitutional matters, and engagement with various communities and organizations. His governance reflects a multifaceted approach with policy-making aimed at addressing both immediate and long-term challenges facing South Africa. An observation was made that across the trigrams per president, criminal justice system has appeared various time, which also means that crime is still a persistent problem in South Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Top 20 trio of words (trigrams) used by each president. A relates to Mandela’s trigrams, B relates to deKlerk’s trigrams, C relates to Mbeki’s trigrams, D relates to Zuma’s trigrams, E relates to Motlanthe’s trigrams, and F relates to Ramaphosa’s trigrams."

    "section": "3.2 Sentiment Analysis",
    "text": "3.2 Sentiment Analysis\nPlot A of Figure 3 is a typical example of the presidents trying to improve the well-being of the local population, especially those who live in informal settlements suffering from basic amenities. So, the positive trigrams highlighted a range of policy areas, projects and achievements, including social welfare, economic development, public services, infrastructure, and international engagement.\nFor plot B, there were several words like gross domestic product, crime prevention strategy, sexual offence court, prosecute authority npa, sexual office unit, passenger rail agency, gross fix capital, fight organise crime, emergency task team, corruption task team, and corruption advisory council which should not have been categorised as negative sentiment. Nevertheless, the problem for crime seemed persistent which was why a criminal justice system needed refinement. Although the criminal justice system is a positive sentiment, we treated it as negative because if there were no crimes, it would be pointless to have a criminal justice system. So, its existence entailed the unsolved problem of crime in the country. In fact, the same logic could be argued with regards to sexual offence court.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 20 positive (A) and negative (B) trio of words (trigrams) used by all presidents.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 depicts the positive sentiment of trigrams per president. Mandela’s positive sentiment focused on social welfare, economic development, social justice, reconciliation, and peace. He worked to create a more inclusive and just society while addressing a range of challenges, both domestic and international. He wanted to promote black empowerment as he was fighting for the abolition of apartheid. So, Mandela’s commitment to building a post-apartheid South Africa that was democratic, equitable, and prosperous is still engraved in our heart. His main priority seemed to be the provision for free medical care. Since deKlerk was only a 1-term president, only 9 unique positive trigrams were obtained. His focus on building trust, finding practical solutions, and ensuring genuine autonomy and constitutional safeguards indicated a commitment to resolving issues related to apartheid, political reform, and peace-building. It was consistent with his role in initiating negotiations to end apartheid and lead South Africa towards a more inclusive and democratic future. The top 20 positive sentiment trigrams for Mbeki was focused on infrastructure and basic amenities development, social welfare, economic growth, and international cooperation (i.e, afro-asian solidarity). He definitely tried to promote unity and solidarity in South Africa. Zuma’s positive sentiment trigrams showcased an all-rounded presidency with a focus on social welfare, diplomacy, economic development, public health, and governance. The positive sentiment trigrams from Motlanthe also being a 1-term president aimed to address a range of issues, including economic growth, social welfare, competitiveness, equitable development, and infrastructure improvement. His administration appeared to have focused on creating a more inclusive and socially responsible society, with an emphasis on social support, economic stability, and equitable access to healthcare. It was no surprise to see that continental free trade was the first positive sentiment trigram for Ramaphosa, as he is always very business-oriented. He was really dedicated to economic growth, social inclusivity, diplomacy, democratic governance, and addressing pressing issues such as land reform and healthcare. He seemed to also focus on collaborative efforts and comprehensive planning to address the nation’s challenges and drive progress. Overall, it was observed that most presidents were promoting child support grant and free basic amenities and clean water.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Top 20 positive trio of words (trigrams) used by each president. A relates to Mandela’s positive trigrams, B relates to deKlerk’s positive trigrams, C relates to Mbeki’s positive trigrams, D relates to Zuma’s positive trigrams, E relates to Motlanthe’s positive trigrams, and F relates to Ramaphosa’s positive trigrams.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the negative sentiment of trigrams per president. Mandela’s presidency emphasised on inclusivity, human rights and social justice as mentioned before. During his time, he unfortunately had to deal with significant challenges, such as crime, corruption, land issues, child abuse and rape, poverty, and environmental concerns. The top 2 sentiments were rather positive, but crime related. Due to deKlerk being a 1-term president, he had only 5 unique negative sentiments trigrams which did not really convey much information apart from words like hopeless, hard negotiation, threaten, conflict and difficulty which only highlighted some challenges and hardships during his presidency without any specific context. Ignoring the trigrams which were supposed to have strictly positive sentiments like gross domestic product and post conflict reconstruction; the crime related matter kept on persisting with some other social matters, public health issues and other political challenges. Again, ignoring gross domestic product being a positive sentiment trigram, the crime issue were on top of the list during Zuma’s presidency. Furthermore, he had to deal with corruption, economic challenges, infrastructural breakdown, and some social and environmental concerns. Motlanthe’s was also a 1-term president and from the trigrams, “poverty decline substantially”, “metric poverty decline”, “input price decline”, “hungry decline dramatically”, “gross fix capital” and “gross domestic product” should be ignored and treated as positive sentiment. This was a good example of the disadvantages of using lexicon-dictionary based approach for sentiment analysis. Nevertheless, crime, inequality, security measure issue, economic issues, political challenges and illicit activities were still the major concerns during his presidency. We again see some false negative sentiment present in the trigrams for Ramaphosa. Ignoring those, he still had to deal with crime related issues, violence in public, poverty, insanitation, water shortage, drug trafficking, debt perhaps due to the global pandemic which he also mentioned. It was quite clear that throughout all these year the crime issues, poverty, and violence were not able to eradicate or at a bare minimum to mitigate.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Top 20 negative trio of words (trigrams) used by each president. A relates to Mandela’s negative trigrams, B relates to deKlerk’s negative trigrams, C relates to Mbeki’s negative trigrams, D relates to Zuma’s negative trigrams, E relates to Motlanthe’s negative trigrams, and F relates to Ramaphosa’s negative trigrams.\n\n\n\n\nSo, when we investigated the sentiment over the years from Figure 6, we noticed that plot A had always more positive than negative sentiment and has increased over the years. Except that during Mbeki’s presidency in 2001, the negative sentiment for the trigrams surpassed the positive ones, perhaps because of the rise in HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Plot B shows the fluctuation in count of positive and negative sentiment throughout the years. It is worth noting that the positive sentiments were larger than the negative sentiments. Consider the positive sentiment, the fluctuations occurrences indicates the positive sentiment count in the previous year tend to be higher than the following year relative to the previous year. This means that the presidents were hopeful for country to implement the project as planned, however, in the following year they always have to deal with some societal or economic challenges which caused the drop in the positive sentiment. This observation was supported in Miranda and Bringula (2021) as well, meaning that in general that tends to be the case. Another interesting observation was that whenever there was a peak in negative sentiment, logically we would guess a drop in positive sentiment below the negative sentiment (i.e, more negative sentiment than positive sentiment). However, whenever the negative sentiment was very high, the positive sentiment also increased. That means whenever there’s something bad happening, the politicians tend to cover it up with good or positive speeched to decrease tension and mask the actuality. Moreoverm the trends between the positive and negative sentiment had increased over the years and the sudden drop in positive and negative sentiment in 2020 was due to the global pandemic covid-19. So, as a final observation, it seemed as if over the years the South African presidents were improved and did better with an increasing trend in positive sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Positive and negative trio of words (trigrams) sentiment over time (excluding 1-term presidents such as deKlerk and Motlanthe). A corresponds to how many more positive than negative trigrams (or vice versa) computed over the years [1994-2023]. So, the y-axis for A was calculated as Sentiment = positive trigrams - negative trigrams. B refers to the actual count of positive and negative trigrams throughout the same mentioned period. The bounding boxes indicate which part of this timeline belongs to the presidency period of Mandela, Mbeki, Zuma and Ramaphosa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Evolution of emotions expressed over time from 1994-2023 by all presidents.\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 7, we observe the evolution of emotional dynamics over time. Notably, there is a distinct upswing in the expression of positive emotions, particularly from 2009 when President Zuma assumed office. This trend potentially signifies President Zuma’s leadership style, which may have prioritized positivity, unity, and motivation. Alternatively, it could imply that his speeches served as a means of crisis management, offering reassurance to the public and reinforcing the notion of stability and control during challenging times. We can observe a significant increase in negative emotions during the time frame spanning 2021 to 2023, marked notably by heightened expressions of fear and sadness. This trend can be traced back to the profound global impact of the novel coronavirus, which affected nations worldwide in 2020."
